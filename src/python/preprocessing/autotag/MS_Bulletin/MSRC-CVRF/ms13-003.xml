    <cvrf:Note Title="Executive Summary" Audience="Public" Type="Summary" Ordinal="2" xml:lang="en">This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft System Center Operations Manager. The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if a user visits an affected website by way of a specially crafted URL. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit such a website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the affected website.</cvrf:Note>
